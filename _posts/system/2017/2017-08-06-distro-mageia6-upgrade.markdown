### Preface

After painting my fence and ladder at home with brown-violet colour,
I finally got few hours time to continue my genealogy project tonight, 
but the Mageia Linux at home needed to upgraded. Therefore I did.

*sigh* I need to postpone my genealogy project.

### Just a few command line

This is the process

{% highlight bash %}
$ su
# urpmi.removemedia -a
# urpmi.addmedia --distrib --mirrorlist 'http://mirrors.mageia.org/api/mageia.6.$ARCH.list'
# urpmi --replacefiles --auto-update --auto
# urpme --auto-orphans
{% endhighlight %}

I have used Mageia since 2014.
And this old article has a more complete review.

I'm just showing that I'm still single.
I ain't got  nowhere tonight but my desktop.

### Notes

A few notes on post install

(1)	DNF

Must install manually

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo urpmi dnf
{% endhighlight %}

Other than that, dnf works like a charm.

(2)	Compiz Issue

After install gnome lost all panel.
Therefore I go back to XFCE4, which is lost window border.

And "$ xfwm4 -- replace" also does not work since compiz has the deafult Window Manager.

The next thing I did is "$ sudo urpme compiz" and logout.

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo urpme compiz
{% endhighlight %}

After this procedure both gnome-shell and XFCE4 works normal as it should be.

(3)	Plasma5

Must install manually

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo urpmi task-plasma5
{% endhighlight %}
