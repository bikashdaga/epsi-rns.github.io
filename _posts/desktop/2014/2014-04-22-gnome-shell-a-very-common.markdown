Sometimes in the middle of hard work,
you have to wait for something that delaying your job.
Later got bored because of you got too much free time.
So let's play with coky and stuff.

### A very common Desktop Customization.

{% capture ss_content %}
<strong>OS</strong>: Debian<br/>
<strong>DE</strong>: gnome-shell<br/>
  + cairo-dock<br/>
  + conky-infinity<br/>
  + background
{% endcapture %}

{% include part/screenshot.html ss_content = ss_content %}

I'm glad that GNU/Linux has a modern desktop interface.
While others are still using conventional approach.

It can be customized further using
gnome-shell has extensions to make you far from bored

* <https://extensions.gnome.org/>

And user themes, though I rarely need it.
