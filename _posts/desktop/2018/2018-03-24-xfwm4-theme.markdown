> Tutor Three: Flat Design, Minimalist PNG Button

### Inkscape Document

	This is the Inkscape Part.

#### Get the SVG

You may make from scratch or get my <code>tutor-03-button.svg</code> from my dotfiles repository at github.

#### Slices

Before you begin this the slices that we want to achieve.

![xfwm4 Theme: Tutor 03 - Slices Preview][image-ss-tutor-03-slices]{: .img-responsive }

#### Border

I won't give much explanation.
We're already have border tutorial in previous article.

We are using 10px border for this theme.
Additionaly, the top has 14px height.
10px solid, with additional 4px empty space.

![xfwm4 Theme: Tutor 03 - Border Preview][image-ss-tutor-03-border]{: .img-responsive }

Just export each PNG boxes and test the theme border.

#### Button

There are some window buttons, in my <code>themerc</code>, my layout is:

{% highlight conf %}
button_layout=O|TSHMC
{% endhighlight %}

Let me explain with my own window understanding, or better, with target save button

*	S  : shade

*	St : shade-toggled

*	H  : hide

*	M  : maximize

*	Mt : maximize-toggled (restore)

*	C  : close

*	T  : stick

*	Tt : stick-toggled

*	O  : menu

Each button has states:

*	active

*	inactive

*	prelight (hover)

*	pressed

So we can have a complete button name, for example for close button such as

*	close-active.png

*	close-inactive.png

*	close-prelight.png

*	close-pressed.png

![xfwm4 Theme: Tutor 03 - Button Preview][image-ss-tutor-03-button]{: .img-responsive }

Note that border only have two states [active, inactive], and do not have the other two state [prelight, pressed].

#### Detail

Each box button has the size of [W*H = 20px * 14px].
You can clone my example, or you have your own creation.

I'm using goggle material color: red100, red300, red500, red700, red900.
You can use other color as well such as: blue100, blue300, blue500, blue700, blue900.
Or other color combination, as you desire.

### Minimalist Theme

	This is the XFWM Part.

#### Result

Now, we already have our preview.

![xfwm4 Theme: Tutor 03 - Active Window][image-ss-tutor-03-active]{: .img-responsive }

#### Usability

The issue with minimalist color is that,
it is good in aestethic issue, but lack of functional aspect.
In order to solve this usability issue, I put functional icon on keypressed,
such as the <code>x</code> icon for close.
So that user won't click the wrong button.
