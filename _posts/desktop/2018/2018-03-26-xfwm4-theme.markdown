### Inkscape Document

	This is the Inkscape Part.

#### Get the SVG

You may make from scratch or get my <code>tutor-04-button.svg</code> from my dotfiles repository at github.

#### Slices

Before you begin this the slices that we want to achieve.

![xfwm4 Theme: Tutor 04 - Slices Preview][image-ss-tutor-04-slices]{: .img-responsive }

#### Layers

I utilize some more layers, we are going to build this step by step.

![xfwm4 Theme: Tutor 04 - Layers][image-ss-tutor-04-layers]{: .img-responsive }

#### Size

We are using, only 5px border for this theme.
Except, the top has 24px height.

-- -- --

### Building the XPM

	This is also the Inkscape Part.

Since we are going to use both XPM and PNG, first we should make our flat XPM.

#### Size and Color

We are using, only 5px border for this theme.
Except, the top has 24px height.
All the buttons also have 24px height.

Size:

*	left, right, bottom: 5px

*	top, title, button, menu: 24px

Colors:

*	active: grey200 (#eeeeeeff)

*	inactive: grey400 (#e0e0e0ff)

Create a new layer called XPM and make each boxes as below.

![xfwm4 Theme: Tutor 04 - XPM Slices Preview][image-ss-tutor-04-xpm]{: .img-responsive }


#### Export PNG

	This is not a tricky part.

In general, to export the PNG, you must hide the <code>name</code> layer.
No need to hide the <code>background</code> layer, since no hollow
I mean all box area covered by solid color.

There is no tricky part here.
Just lock all layers, except frames.
Then each time you click any frame box, 
it will show the target filename such as <code>bottom-left-active.png</code>.

Now, please export all necessary boxes.

#### Mogrify

Do not forget to convert to XPM using Mogrify.
And also do not forget to delete all the PNG.

{% highlight bash %}
$ mogrify -format xpm *.png
{% endhighlight %}

#### Tips

Since we are going to concentrate on making PNG,
you may put all the XPMs on ther directory,
and merge later after we're done with all the PNGs.

### Gradient and Highlight

	This is still the Inkscape Part.

#### Layer

I utilize some more layers, such as this two

*	gradient

*	layer

#### Border

Remember that, the top has 24px height.

![xfwm4 Theme: Tutor 04 - Border Preview][image-ss-tutor-04-border]{: .img-responsive }

On <code>gradient</code> layer, over the top border:
I put a box, 24 px height, filled with gradient with four handles as shown above.

*	Handle 0: rgba = (0, 0, 0, 80)

*	Handle 1: rgba = (0, 0, 0, 48)

*	Handle 2: rgba = (0, 0, 0, 24)

*	Handle 1: rgba = (0, 0, 0, 64)

On <code>highlight</code> layer, over the top border: 8px vertical offset of the previous box
I put a box, 16 px height, filled with gradient with two handles.

*	Handle 0: rgba = (255, 255, 255, 255)

*	Handle 1: rgba = (255, 255, 255, 40)

Neither gradient or highlight on inactive border. It is just simply flat.

#### Export

Now that we are done, we can export each PNG boxes and test the theme border.

### Button

	This is still also the Inkscape Part.

#### Specification

*	Size: W*H = 32px * 24px.  Each box button has this size.

*	Colors: Using Google Material: Red, Green , Blue, Orange, Indigo. 
	Each box button has different color. Toggle button has the same color as its base button.

You may have different, to suit your needs.

#### Layout

We are going to make a uniform shape for each button.
Hence, any button layout is fine. 
In my <code>themerc</code>, you can use <code>O|TSHMC</code> layout.

![xfwm4 Theme: Tutor 04 - Button Preview][image-ss-tutor-04-button]{: .img-responsive }

#### Details

There are four details, for each use the same spec as these below

*	Active: 

	*	layer icon: circle of 12 px radius with red300 color

	*	layer icon-border: circle of 16 px radius with white color

	![xfwm4 Theme: Tutor 04 - Detail Active][image-ss-tutor-04-button-active]{: .img-responsive }

* Inactive:

	*	layer icon: circle of 12 px radius with red300 color

	*	layer icon-border: circle of 16 px radius with white color

	![xfwm4 Theme: Tutor 04 - Detail Inactive][image-ss-tutor-04-button-inactive]{: .img-responsive }

* Prelight

	*	layer icon: circle of 12 px radius with red300 color

	*	layer icon-border: circle of 16 px radius with white color

	*	layer button: cut circle of 28 px radius with red700 color

	![xfwm4 Theme: Tutor 04 - Detail Prelight][image-ss-tutor-04-button-prelight]{: .img-responsive }

* Pressed, give an icon to solve usability issue.

	*	layer icon: circle of 12 px radius with red300 color

	*	layer icon-border: circle of 16 px radius with white color

	*	layer button: cut circle of 32 px radius with red700 color

	*	layer icon: <code>x</code> shape with red900 color

	![xfwm4 Theme: Tutor 04 - Detail Pressed][image-ss-tutor-04-button-pressed]{: .img-responsive }

#### Export

	This is a tricky part.

Consider set these layers before export:

*	Locked: icon, icon-border, button, highlight, gradient

*	Unlocked: Frame

*	Hide: name, XPM, background

Now the tricky part, for each border box parts.
We must select the box first in fframe layer,
so we can have the export target filename such as <code>bottom-left-active.png</code>.
Then we have to hide the <code>frame</code> layer, because we want empty space as transparent.
The next thing to do is to click the export button to export PNG.

Unhide the <code>frame</code> layer, to select other box.

### Gradient Theme

	This is the XFWM Part.

#### Configuration

This is the required <code>themerc</code> for this theme.

{% highlight conf %}
active_text_color=#444444
inactive_text_color=#888888

button_offset=2
button_spacing=0

full_width_title=true

maximized_offset=0
show_app_icon=true
shadow_delta_height=-6
shadow_delta_width=-10
shadow_delta_x=-12
shadow_delta_y=-12
shadow_opacity=100

title_horizontal_offset=1
title_shadow_active=false
title_shadow_inactive=under
title_vertical_offset_active=1
title_vertical_offset_inactive=1

button_layout=O|STHMC
{% endhighlight %}

#### Title Font

Optionally, You may set font size <code>0</code> to hide title.

#### XPM

You can use merge GTK color feature into XPM, but I'm too lazy to do that.
This is just for tutorial purpose.

For now, merge the XPM directory to xfwm4 directory,
so the XPM and the PNG has the same directory.

#### Result

Now, we already have our preview.

![xfwm4 Theme: Tutor 04 - Active Window][image-ss-tutor-04-active]{: .img-responsive }

#### Usability

The issue with minimalist color is that,
it is good in aestethic issue, but lack of functional aspect.
In order to solve this usability issue, I put functional icon on keypressed,
such as the <code>x</code> icon for close.
So that user won't click the wrong button.
