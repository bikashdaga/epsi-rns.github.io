Hello There,

I have finally made it,
a desktop ricing with my own original wallpaper.

This article show a rather complete desktop ricing.
From original geeky-art wallpaper made in inkscape.
It continued with original complex conky statusbar,
implemented in i3 tiling window manager.
And last, a Manjaro Logo creation using only Terminal.
I skip all the terminal text ricings to keep its simple looks.

So simple but, we all n00b once, right!

## Sitting Here 

I've been sitting here thinking how people working and making achievement.

I'm still sitting here thinking, while people working.

I'm still thinking, while people making achievement.

People working, and I'm still thinking.

## The Material Wallpaper

Tonight, I feel so "I have no life."
So I made a lame wallpaper with inkscape today.
A wallpaper clone of inpired by Material,
with Isometric Experiment for myself.
I know I looks dumb. Like usual.

[![Isometric Wallpaper with Material Design][image-wallpaper]{: .img-responsive }][hires-wallpaper]

Each Layer contain different color scheme.
So the svg source has more than just this Grey with Red accent.
The text is using Oswald Font.
You can change the text to suite your message.

### Inkscape

Yes, it is an inkscape document.

Additionaly further than Material Design,
I added an Isometric looks. 
Just because I can.

First, I have made an axonometric grid.
This will create an isometric looks document.

* Spacing Y: 8, and changed later to 2, or 4 or 8

* Angle X: 30

* Angle Z: 30

* Major Grid Every 10

## The Tiling Window Manager

### Manjaro Logo

After a while I decide to have a try in i3.
Then suddenly I realize how easy it is,
to make a Manjaro logo with only terminals in i3.

But unfortunately, it looks so lame.
Now I feel a little bad for it. #embarassing

Desktop Ricing would not be complete without your original wallpaper.

What do you think ?
