### Preface

> Goal: Create custom bright colorscheme for XFCE4 Terminal.

It has been more than two years after my last terminal article.
I have been craved to use bright mode,
and having issue with colorscheme with bright color.
This time I found the solution.

### Configuration

#### Directory

First of all, where are the configuration files are placed?

* System wide: `/usr/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes/`

* Per user: `~/.local/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes/`

* Current setting: `~/.config/xfce4/terminal/terminalrc/`

#### Why Bright Colorscheme?

I know some people hate bright colorscheme.
But bright colorscheme might be compelling in a few situation.
For example in my case, I wrote a book and I require a bright colorscheme.
The issue comes when need a screenshot for my free e-book.
This book comes in PDF, and must be allowed to be printed by the reader.
In this context, `dark mode` is not a choice.
I have to use `bright mode`, to reduce ink while printing.

#### Dark Pastel

Consider look at, this `xfce4-terminal` below.
This terminal looks good with `dark-pastel`.

![XFCE4 Terminal - Colorscheme - Dark Pastel][image-dark]

This should be no problem with daily basis.
But how about bright colorscheme?

#### Black on White

The bright mode choice is already exist,
with `black on white` colorscheme in `xfce4-terminal`.

![XFCE4 Terminal - Colorscheme - Black on White][image-bright]

The issue is not all the colors looks visible.
The color is shown in `size` and `build time` in terminal above.

#### Custom Colorscheme

I copy a file from:

* `/usr/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes/black-on-white.theme`

Then `copy` to this directory:

* `~/.local/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes`

And rename to file to `custom-black-on-white.theme`.

After this, I change the colorscheme name to `Custom Black on White`.

{% highlight bash %}
[Scheme]
Name=Custom Black on White
ColorForeground=#000000
ColorBackground=#ffffff
{% endhighlight %}

Now we have this colorscheme in `xfce4-terminal`'s preset.

![XFCE4 Terminal - Colorscheme - Presets][image-presets]

I will modify the content later.

#### Black on White with Solarized Text

The easier way to solve this is,
using colorscheme from `solarized (light)`.

* `/usr/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes/solarized-light.theme`

Now we have configuration as below:

{% highlight bash %}
[Scheme]
Name=Custom Black on White
ColorForeground=#000000
ColorBackground=#ffffff
ColorPalette=#073642;#dc322f;#859900;#b58900;#268bd2;#d33682;#2aa198;#eee8d5;#002b36;#cb4b16;#586e75;#657b83;#839496;#6c71c4;#93a1a1;#fdf6e3
{% endhighlight %}

![XFCE4 Terminal - Colorscheme - Black on White][image-solarized]

#### Black on White with Custom Solarized Text

If you need enough contrast, then you can change the `RGB` color.
Consider, have a look at, the configuration here:

{% highlight bash %}
ColorPalette=...;#839496;#6c71c4;#93a1a1;#fdf6e3
{% endhighlight %}

With just guess (or trial an error),
I find the color responsible fot this is `#93a1a1`.

Consider to change the `#93a1a1` to  `#435151`,
or any color that you want.
So we have this configuration

{% highlight bash %}
ColorPalette=...;#839496;#6c71c4;#435151;#fdf6e3
{% endhighlight %}

Voila. We have the result as below:

![XFCE4 Terminal - Colorscheme - Custom Color][image-custom]

Since this bright terminal has been solved.
Now I can concentrate to my blog material.
I can go back, busy with scribus, writing an ebook.
