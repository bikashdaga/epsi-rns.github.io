  Curious about doing Vexel in Inkscape? Yes, it can be done!
  Although as an amateur I can't make it smoother yet.

I never have my own photographs, and it give me difficulties everytime I need an avatar. In 2012 somebody took a good picture of me, but it is blurry. So I decided to make a scalable vector version of my photograph that I can use for profile picture.

I'm an inkscape n00b. I haven't got time to do low poly tracing. So this is it. Vexel with manual tracing.

And this pair, if you want to see the comparation between manual tracing and the original.

I currently do not have any plan to modify this vector. e.g. Adding beard, moustache, or long hair.

At least I have something for my avatar.
