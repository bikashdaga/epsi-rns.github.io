## Github

There is a very popular free git website, github.com.
Just sign up, and create a new repository.

I'm using git for my github.io site.

* <https://github.com/epsi-rns/epsi-rns.github.io>

After create a new repository,
github will give a short notification similar to mine below.

Just follow below step in your directory.

	git init
	git add README.md
	git commit -m "first commit"
	git remote add origin https://github.com/epsi-rns/dotfiles.git
	git push -u origin master
	â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line

I have already prepared my local git Directory.
So every git commands must be within this local directory.

{% highlight bash %}
 $ cd /media/Works/Development/github/epsi-rns.github.io/
{% endhighlight %}

## Shell Command

For daily updating, all you need is this command

{% highlight bash %}
 $ git status
 $ git add --all
 $ git commit -m "your messages here"
 $ git push -u origin master
{% endhighlight %}

I use it over and over again.
Exactly in that sequence.

Luckily linux shell can remember the command,
so you don't need to type it again and again.

For convenience, 
I like to use powerline to show master repo in my shell.
You can see in this figure, it shown in right position of the shell.

Unfortunately bash doesn't support this feature,
so I use fish instead.

You can see git in action in this figure bbelow

## Read The Fine Manual

RTFM as usual.

{% highlight bash %}
 $ man git
 $ man git-add
 $ man git-mv
{% endhighlight %}

After a while you will get bored with those basic commands,
then you might want to try a more geeky command.
Just read git oficial documentation.

## Tagging

You can tag a specific point in your history,
Here, is our recurring command.

{% highlight bash %}
 $ git tag -a 0.1 -m "First Tagging: Milestone 0.1"
 $ git push -u origin 0.1
{% endhighlight %}
