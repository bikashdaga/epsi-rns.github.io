excerpt:
  This two products, Docker (go-based) and Servo (rust-based), is a compelling reason.
  We have to take a peek on the language they are based on. 
  Both are still bleeding edge technologies. So we still have to make a bet on it.

Two language of the future beside C and C++.<br/>

1. Go
2. Rust

Both are still bleeding edge technologies. Even though they already have proven product e.g. Docker (go-based) and Servo (rust-based). You still have to make a bet on it. Nobody says that it would be easy.
<br/><br/>

After Sun acquisition by Oracle, and legal dispute with Oracle over Android's use of Java in Dalvik. Google has secretly developed Go-language. But Java will not be, just fading away. Java is too big to fail.
<br/><br/>

Rust, has clearly define their capability by creating a rust-based OS.<br/>

<br/><br/>

I still have no idea, Redox is all about. But hey... I like the idea of linux replacement. We need an alternative, as linux is already too mainstream. Soon we have few new contenders in the market: #reactos #hurd #redox #linux++
<br/><br/>

IMO: This kind of forward lookin' is what HP people have to do when they started to make a new OS for memristor. Instead of making linux++ for developers, and built their own new OS with obsolete technology. This bleeding edge memristor hardware, require a breakthrough. You are supposed to be a leader, not a linux follower!
<br/><br/>

Well, that's just my opinion. I do not have any formal IT education. Nor professional IT job. <br/>
So who am I to speak ?
