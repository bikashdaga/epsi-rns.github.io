A very common Desktop Customization.

**OS**: Debian<br/>
**DE**: gnome-shell<br/>
+ cairo-dock<br/>
+ conky-infinity<br/>
+ background<br/>

I'm glad that linux has a modern desktop interface.
While others are still using conventional approach.

It can be customized further using
gnome-shell has extensions to make you far from bored

* <https://extensions.gnome.org/>

And user themes, though I rarely need it.
