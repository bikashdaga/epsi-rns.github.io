I recommend Awesome WM for first time Tiling Window Manager.
It is not intimidating, as it still has built in menu.

Moving from a full feature Desktop Environment
to limited feature Window Manager takes some time.
It is even harder to move from Stacking Window Manager
to Tiling Window Manager. So pick the easiest one, the Awesome WM.
Awesome has floating option to make you feel like you are in stacking WM.
