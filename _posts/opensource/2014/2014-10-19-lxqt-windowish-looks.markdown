This is not a prank.
You can have this Windowish looks with Arch LXQT.
And be happy with it.

'qterminal', is my new comfort in the shell.

**OS**: Arch<br/>
**DE**: LXQT 0.8<br/>
<br/>

LXQT's File Manager, PC Man FM also give me stunning nostalgic looks,
remind me of my happy childhood day.

But don't get so depressed.
The original LXQT has great looks.

Let's see how it can be combined with KWin instead of Openbox.

**OS**: Arch<br/>
**DE**: LXQT 0.8<br/>
**WM**: KWin (x11)<br/>
+ Conky Manager<br/>
+ Ghost Theme<br/>
<br/>
