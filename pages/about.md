	There are so many things to say.
	I don't want to live in regrets.
	So I make this blog.

Hello, my name is Epsi. I'm an open source enthusiast.

This is my temporary about page. 
I haven't got time to decorate it yet.
I'm still busy of something else.

You can read a glance about me here

This about page will have something else.

	It's not that I need to share.
	I just want to back it up to cloud.
